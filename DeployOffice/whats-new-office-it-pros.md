## June 2020

### Update channels for Microsoft 365 Apps renamed
The names of the update channels for Microsoft 365 Apps have changed. For example, Monthly Channel is now named Current Channel and Semi-Annual Channel is now named Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel. To learn more, including what actions you might need to take, see [Changes to update channels for Microsoft 365 Apps](update-channels-changes.md).

## May 2020

### Introduction of Monthly Enterprise Channel
A new update channel for Microsoft 365 Apps is now available: Monthly Enterprise Channel. This update channel provides new Office features once a month, on the second Tuesday of the month. These once-a-month updates will also include, as needed, security updates and non-security updates. 

You can deploy Monthly Enterprise Channel just like you would any other update channel. For example, by using the Office Deployment Tool, Group Policy, or Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager.

For more information, see [Overview of update channels for Microsoft 365 Apps](overview-update-channels.md).

## April 2020

### Office 365 ProPlus renamed
Office 365 ProPlus has been renamed to **Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise**, starting with Version 2004. To learn more, including what actions you might need to take, see [Name change for Office 365 ProPlus](name-change.md). In our documentation, we'll usually just refer to it as Microsoft 365 Apps.

### Best practices articles
We've published two new best practice articles from the field:[Choose how to install Microsoft 365 Apps](fieldnotes/install-options.md) and [Choose how to deliver updates for Microsoft 365 Apps](fieldnotes/choose-how-to-deliver-updates.md). 

### Viewer mode
Viewer mode allows unlicensed users of Microsoft 365 Apps to view and print Office files without being prompted to activate Office. To use viewer mode, you must have version 1902 of Microsoft 365 Apps or later. To enable viewer mode, your organization must have an Office 365 or Microsoft 365 license subscription. For more information, see [Overview of viewer mode](overview-viewer-mode.md).

## March 2020

We're starting to publish best practice articles from Microsoft experts in the field who work with enterprise customers to deploy Office. The first article is now live: [Build dynamic, lean, universal packages for Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise](fieldnotes/build-dynamic-lean-universal-packages.md).

## November 2019

After deploying Microsoft 365 Apps, you can change the update channel for a device by using Group Policy or the Office Deployment Tool (ODT). For example, you can move a device from Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel to Monthly Enterprise Channel. We've published a new article that covers how to change the update channel. For more information, see [Change the Microsoft 365 Apps update channel for devices in your organization](change-update-channels.md).

## October 2019

### Privacy controls for Office on iOS devices

Starting with Version 2.30 of the Office apps for iOS, there are new preference settings that allow you to control settings related to diagnostic data and connected experiences. For more information, see [Use preferences to manage privacy controls for Office on iOS devices](privacy/ios-privacy-preferences.md).

## September 2019

### General availability of Security Policy Advisor
Security Policy Advisor is now generally available. You can use Security Policy Advisor to receive and implement security policy recommendations that are based on Microsoft best practices and information about your existing environment. Security Policy Advisor can only be used in combination with the Office cloud policy service.

For more information, see this [blog post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Security-Privacy-and-Compliance/Security-Policy-Advisor-for-Office-365-ProPlus-is-now-Generally/ba-p/835778) and [Overview of Security Policy Advisor for Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise](overview-of-security-policy-advisor.md).

### Windows 7 end of support and Microsoft 365 Apps
***Support for Windows 7 ended on January 14, 2020.*** Using Microsoft 365 Apps on older, unsupported operating systems may cause performance and reliability issues over time. Therefore, if your organization is using Microsoft 365 Apps on devices running Windows 7, we strongly recommend your organization move those devices to [Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/windows/end-of-windows-7-support?rtc=1#office-ContentAreaHeadingTemplate-s9f0ou1).

Even though Windows 7 is longer supported, we've decided to continue to provide you with security updates for Microsoft 365 Apps for the next three years, until January 2023. For more information, see [Windows 7 end of support and Microsoft 365 Apps](endofsupport/windows-7-support.md).

### Delivery Optimization and Microsoft 365 Apps
Delivery Optimization is a peer-to-peer distribution technology available in Windows 10 that allows devices to share content, such as updates, that the devices have downloaded from Microsoft over the internet. Delivery Optimization can help reduce network bandwidth because a device can get portions of the update from another device on its local network instead of having to download the update completely from Microsoft. 

Microsoft 365 Apps on devices running Windows 10 can take advantage of Delivery Optimization during installation and when receiving updates, if certain requirements are met. For more information, see [Delivery Optimization and Microsoft 365 Apps](delivery-optimization.md).

For more information, see [Deploy Office for Mac from the Mac App Store](mac/deploy-mac-app-store.md).


## October 2018

The [Office Customization Tool](https://config.office.com/) is now generally available. The OCT makes it easy to customize your deployment of Microsoft 365 Apps and other Click-to-Run Office products. Instead of building the configuration files in a text editor, you can now use this simple web-based interface. Go directly to the [tool](https://config.office.com/) or read more about it [here](overview-of-the-office-customization-tool-for-click-to-run.md).

When installing language packs, you can save network bandwidth by installing only proofing tools.

For best practices on deploying Microsoft 365 Apps with Configuration Manager, see [our new article](deploy-microsoft-365-apps-configuration-manager.md).

## September 2018

Office 2019 is the latest version of Microsoft's productivity software that's available as a one-time purchase from a retail store or through a volume licensing agreement. Office 2019 is separate from Office that's available through Office 365 (or Microsoft 365) plans. For example, if you've deployed Microsoft 365 Apps to the users in your organization, you don't need Office 2019. You already have all the features, and many more, that are included in Office 2019.
