# Connected experiences in Office

> [!NOTE]
> For a list of Office products covered by this privacy information, see [Privacy controls available for Office products](products-versions-privacy-controls.md).

Office consists of client software applications and connected experiences designed to enable you to create, communicate, and collaborate more effectively. Working with others on a document stored on OneDrive or translating the contents of a Word document into a different language are examples of connected experiences.

## Connected experiences that analyze your content

Connected experiences that analyze your content are experiences that use your Office content to provide you with design recommendations, editing suggestions, data insights, and similar features. For example, PowerPoint Designer or Translator.

The following table provides a list of connected experiences that analyze your content and also provides links to more information about them.

>\*When users are signed in with a work or school account, the connected experiences listed above in italics are optional and are provided under the terms of the [Microsoft Services Agreement](https://www.microsoft.com/servicesagreement) and [privacy statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/), and other terms may also apply. For more information, see [Overview of optional connected experiences in Office](optional-connected-experiences.md). If you're an admin, these connected experiences can be managed by privacy controls for connected experiences or by the *Allow the use of additional optional connected experiences in Office* policy setting.

## Choose whether these connected experiences are available to use

You can choose whether certain types of connected experiences, such as connected experiences that download online content, are available to use. How you make that choice depends on whether you are signed into Office with a Microsoft account, such as a personal outlook.com email address, or with a work or school account.

If you are signed in with a Microsoft account, open an Office app, such as Word, and go to **File** > **Account** > **Account Privacy** > **Manage Settings**. Under the **Connected experiences** section, you can choose whether certain types of connected experiences, such as experiences that analyze your content, are available to use. If you don't go to **Manage Settings**, all connected experiences will be available to you.

If you are signed in with a work or school account, the admin in your organization will decide whether these connected experiences are available to you. You won't see any choices for these connected experiences if you go to **File** > **Account** > **Account Privacy** > **Manage Settings**.

> [!NOTE]
> - If you're using Office for Mac, open any Office application and select the app menu (such as Word, or Excel) > **Preferences** > **Privacy**. This will open the Account Privacy settings dialog box where you can see your privacy options.
> - For more information, see [Account Privacy Settings](https://support.microsoft.com/office/3e7bc183-bf52-4fd0-8e6b-78978f7f121b).

If you are the admin for your organization, you can use policy settings to determine whether these connected experiences are available to your users. If you don't use these policy settings, all connected experiences will be available for your users. For more information about using these policy settings, see the following articles: 

- [Use policy settings to manage privacy controls for Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise](manage-privacy-controls.md)
- [Use preferences to manage privacy controls for Office for Mac](mac-privacy-preferences.md).
- [Use preferences to manage privacy controls for Office on iOS devices](ios-privacy-preferences.md)
- [Use policy settings to manage privacy controls for Office on Android devices](android-privacy-controls.md)

If you choose to turn off some types of connected experiences, either the ribbon or menu command for those connected experiences will be grayed out or you will get an error message when you try to use those connected experiences.

Even if you decide to turn off these connected experiences, certain Office functionality will remain available, such as synching a mailbox in Outlook, and Teams and Skype for Business will continue to work. Also, there is a set of services that are essential to how Office functions that can't be turned off, such as the licensing service that confirms that you are properly licensed to use Office.
