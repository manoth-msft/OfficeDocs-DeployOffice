# Update deadline

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is pre-release documentation for a preview program that isnâ€™t available to everyone and is subject to change.

To make sure that your users apply updates to Microsoft 365 Apps, you can configure an update deadline. The deadline specifies how long an update can be available on a device before the updates must be applied. If the updates aren't applied by the deadline, Office automatically closes any open Office programs and applies the updates.

Users are given notifications leading up to the deadline when a deadline is set. For more information about user notifications, see [notifications your users see when you set an update deadline](../end-user-update-notifications-microsoft-365-apps.md#notifications-your-users-see-when-you-set-an-update-deadline-for-microsoft-365-apps).
