- Up to date – Device that has installed the [latest security patch](https://docs.microsoft.com/officeupdates/microsoft365-apps-security-updates)
- Not up to date – Device that has not installed the most recent security update
- Unknown – Status of the security update could not be retrieved.

You can also drill down into all devices on or view the devices that are not up to date.

## Set a goal for updating devices

To set a goal for updating devices and view your progress against that goal, click **Set a goal** on the Security device status page. You can specify the percentage of devices you want  to update and the schedule for meeting that target.
